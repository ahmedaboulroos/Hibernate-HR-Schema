# Hibernate-HR-Schema
Learning Hibernate ORM through Mapping Oracle's HR Schema to Classes and perform Operations on the Database.

<br/>

> Goals
- To map the HR Schema of Oracle Database to Objects and Classes in Java.
- To Use Hibernate Mapping Facilities to do so (by using Annotations).
- Perform CRUD Operations using JPA Entity Manager on the mapped entities.
- Perform Queries against the database using JPQL and the Criteria API.
- We leverage the JUnit Jupiter API to perform some tests.
- We Demonstrate Second Level Caching on Entities and Collections within these Entities

<br />

> Notes
- The Tests in this Example is for demonstrations only of how to use JPA.
- These tests don't follow best practices, also they are not unit nor integration tests.
- Testing DAOs, Repositories or Database Operations : should be an Integration Testing.
